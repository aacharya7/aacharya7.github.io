# Introduction 
Hi everyone!
My name is Ayeshra Acharya and I am a 2nd year Master of Public Health candidate in Epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Some of my interests include maternal and reproductive health and disparities in breast cancer diagnosis and screening. 

During my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring different parks in New York City and cooking!

You can learn more about my professional and academic experience [here](about.html).
